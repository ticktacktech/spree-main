## Default configuration

By default Spree is mounted at the root of your domain, this code will be inserted into `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
mount Spree::Core::Engine, at: '/'
```

This means that Spree will be available at the root of your domain, for example `http://localhost:3000`.

## Customizing the mount point

You can customize this simply by changing the `:at` specification in `config/routes.rb` to be something else. For example, if you would like Spree to be mounted at `/shop`, you can write this:

```ruby
mount Spree::Core::Engine, at: `/shop`
```

The different parts of Spree (API, Admin) will be mounted there as well, eg. `http://localhost:3000/shop/products`.

## Customizing admin panel path

<Info>
Remember to have the `spree_backend` installed.
</Info>

By default, Spree Admin is mounted at `/admin` and is accessible at `http://localhost:3000/admin`.

You can change the path of the admin panel by setting the `admin_path` option in your `config/initializers/spree.rb` file, eg.

```ruby
Spree.admin_path = '/dashboard'
```

This will change the path of the Spree Admin to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`.
