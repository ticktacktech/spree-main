# Preferences

## Overview

Spree Preferences support general application configuration and preferences per model instance. Spree comes with preferences for your application like `track_inventory_levels`. Additional preferences can be added by your application or included extensions.

To implement preferences for a model, simply add a new column called `preferences`. This is an example migration for the `spree_products` table:

```ruby
class AddPreferencesColumnToSpreeProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[4.2]
  def change
    add_column :spree_products, :preferences, :text
  end
end
```

This will work because `Spree::Product` is a subclass of `Spree::Base`. If found, the `preferences` attribute gets serialized into a `Hash` and merged with the default values.

As another example, you might want to add preferences for users to manage their notification settings. Just make sure your `User` model inherits from `Spree::Base` then add the `preferences` column. You'll then be able to define preferences for `User`s without adding extra columns to the database table.

> If you're using `spree_auth_devise`, note that the provided `Spree::User` doesn't inherit from `Spree::Base`.

Extensions may add to the Spree General Settings or create their own namespaced preferences.

The first several sections of this guide describe preferences in a very general way. If you're just interested in making modifications to the existing preferences, you can skip ahead to the [Configuring Spree Preferences section](preferences#configuring-spree-preferences). If you would like a more in-depth understanding of the underlying concepts used by the preference system, please read on.

### Motivation

Preferences for models within an application are very common. Although the rule of thumb is to keep the number of preferences available to a minimum, sometimes it's necessary if you want users to have optional preferences like disabling e-mail notifications.

Both use cases are handled by Spree Preferences. They are easy to define, provide quick cached reads, persist across restarts and do not require additional columns to be added to your models' tables.

## General Settings

Spree comes with many application-wide preferences. They are defined in `core/app/models/spree/app_configuration.rb` and made available to your code through `Spree::Config`, e.g., `Spree::Config.track_inventory_levels`.

A limited set of the general settings are available in the admin interface of your store (`/admin/general_settings`).

You can add additional preferences under the `spree/app_configuration` namespace or create your own subclass of `Preferences::Configuration`.

```ruby
# These will be saved with key: spree/app_configuration/hot_salsa
Spree::AppConfiguration.class_eval do
  preference :hot_salsa, :boolean
  preference :dark_chocolate, :boolean, default: true
  preference :color, :string
  preference :favorite_number
  preference :language, :string, default: 'English'
end

# Spree::Config is an instance of Spree::AppConfiguration
Spree::Config.hot_salsa = false

# Create your own class
# These will be saved with key: kona/store_configuration/hot_coffee
Kona::StoreConfiguration < Preferences::Configuration
  preference :hot_coffee, :boolean
  preference :color, :string, default: 'black'
end

KONA::STORE_CONFIG = Kona::StoreConfiguration.new
puts KONA::STORE_CONFIG.hot_coffee
```

## Defining Preferences

You can define preferences for a model within the model itself:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  preference :hot_salsa, :boolean
  preference :dark_chocolate, :boolean, default: true
  preference :color, :string
  preference :favorite_number, :integer
  preference :language, :string, default: "English"
end
```

In the above model, five preferences have been defined:

* `hot_salsa`
* `dark_chocolate`
* `color`
* `favorite_number`
* `language`

For each preference, a data type is provided. The types available are:

* `boolean`
* `string`
* `password`
* `integer`
* `text`
* `array`
* `hash`

An optional default value may be defined which will be used unless a value has been set for that specific instance.

## Accessing Preferences

Once preferences have been defined for a model, they can be accessed either using the shortcut methods that are generated for each preference or the generic methods that are not specific to a particular preference.

### Shortcut Methods

There are several shortcut methods that are generated. They are shown below.

Query methods:

```ruby
user.prefers_hot_salsa? # => false
user.prefers_dark_chocolate? # => false
```

Reader methods:

```ruby
user.preferred_color      # => nil
user.preferred_language   # => "English"
```

Writer methods:

```ruby
user.prefers_hot_salsa = false         # => false
user.preferred_language = "English"    # => "English"
```

Check if a preference is available:

```ruby
user.has_preference? :hot_salsa
```

### Generic Methods

Each shortcut method is essentially a wrapper for the various generic methods shown below:

Query method:

```ruby
user.prefers?(:hot_salsa)       # => false
user.prefers?(:dark_chocolate)  # => false
```

Reader methods:

```ruby
user.preferred(:color)      # => nil
user.preferred(:language)   # => "English"
```

```ruby
user.get_preference :color
user.get_preference :language
```

Writer method:

```ruby
user.set_preference(:hot_salsa, false)     # => false
user.set_preference(:language, "English")  # => "English"
```

### Accessing All Preferences

You can get a hash of all stored preferences by accessing the `preferences` helper:

```ruby
user.preferences # => {"language"=>"English", "color"=>nil}
```

This hash will contain the value for every preference that has been defined for the model instance, whether the value is the default or one that has been previously stored.

### Default and Type

You can access the default value for a preference:

```ruby
user.preferred_color_default # => 'blue'
```

Types are used to generate forms or display the preference. You can also get the type defined for a preference:

```ruby
user.preferred_color_type # => :string
```

## Configuring Spree Preferences

Up until now we've been discussing the general preference system that was adapted to Spree. This has given you a general idea of what types of preference features are theoretically supported. Now, let's start to look specifically at how Spree is using these preferences for configuration.

### Reading the Current Preferences

At the heart of Spree preferences lies the `Spree::Config` constant. This object provides general access to the configuration settings anywhere in the application.

These settings can be accessed from initializers, models, controllers, views, etc.

The `Spree::Config` constant returns an instance of `Spree::AppConfiguration` which is where the default values for all of the general Spree preferences are defined.

You can access these preferences directly in code. To see this in action, just fire up `rails console` and try the following:

```ruby
>> Spree::Config.admin_products_per_page
=> 10
```

The above examples show the default configuration values for these preferences. The defaults themselves are coded within the `Spree::AppConfiguration` class.

```ruby
class Spree::AppConfiguration < Configuration
  #... snip ...
  preference :allow_guest_checkout, :boolean, default: true
  #... snip ...
end
```

If you are using the default preferences without any modifications, then nothing will be stored in the database. If you set a value for the preference it will save it to `spree_preferences` or in our `preferences` column. It will use a memory cached version to maintain performance.

### Overriding the Default Preferences

The default Spree preferences in `Spree::AppConfiguration` can be changed using the `set` method of the `Spree::Config` module. For example to set the number of products shown on the products listing in the admin interface we could do the following:

```ruby
>> Spree::Config.admin_products_per_page = 20
=> 20
>> Spree::Config.admin_products_per_page
=> 20
```

Here we are changing a preference to something other than the default as specified in `Spree::AppConfiguration`. In this case the preference system will persist the new value in the `spree_preferences` table.

### Configuration Through the Spree Initializer

During the Spree installation process, an initializer file is created within your application's source code. The initializer is found under `config/initializers/spree.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  Spree.config do |config|
    # Example:
    # Uncomment to stop tracking inventory levels in the application
    # config.track_inventory_levels = false
  end
end
```

Note that if using Rails 7, you'll need to wrap the `Spree.config` block in an `Rails.application.config.after_initialize` block to avoid getting an error when booting up the app.

The `Spree.config` block acts as a shortcut to setting `Spree::Config` multiple times. If you have multiple default preferences you would like to override within your code you may override them here. Using the initializer for setting the defaults is a nice shortcut, and helps keep your preferences organized in a standard location.

For example, if you would like to tax using the shipping address you can accomplish this by doing the following:

```ruby
Spree.config do |config|
  config.tax_using_ship_address = true
end
```

Initializing preferences in `config/initializers/spree.rb` will overwrite any changes that were made through the admin user interface when you restart.

### Configuration Through the Admin Interface

The Spree admin interface has several different screens where various settings can be configured. For instance, the `admin/general_settings` URL in your Spree application can be used to configure the values for the site name and the site URL. This is basically equivalent to calling `Spree::Config.set(currency: "CDN", currency_thousands_separator: " ")` directly in your Ruby code.

## Site-Wide Preferences

You can define preferences that are site-wide and don't apply to a specific instance of a model by creating a configuration file that inherits from `Spree::Preferences::Configuration`.

```ruby
class Spree::MyApplicationConfiguration < Spree::Preferences::Configuration
  preference :theme, :string, default: "Default"
  preference :show_splash_page, :boolean
  preference :number_of_articles, :integer
end
```

In the above configuration file, three preferences have been defined:

* theme
* show_splash_page
* number_of_articles

It is recommended to create the configuration file in the `lib/` directory.

Extensions can also define site-wide preferences. For more information on using preferences like this with extensions, check out the [Extensions Tutorial](/developer/contributing/creating-an-extension).

### Configuring Site-Wide Preferences

The recommended way to configure site-wide preferences is through an initializer. Let's take a look at configuring the preferences defined in the previous configuration example.

```ruby
module Spree
  MyApp::Config = Spree::MyApplicationConfiguration.new
end

MyApp::Config[:theme] = "blue_theme"
MyApp::Config[:show_spash_page] = true
MyApp::Config[:number_of_articles] = 5
```

The `MyApp` name used here is an example and should be replaced with your actual application's name, found in `config/application.rb`.

The above example will configure the preferences we defined earlier. Take note of the second line. In order to set and get preferences using `MyApp::Config`, we must first instantiate the configuration object.
