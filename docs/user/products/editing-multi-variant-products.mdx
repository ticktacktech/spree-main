Editing multi-variant products is it bit more complicated than single-variant products, since each variant can (and may need to be) modified separately.

To edit a multi-variant product, first find the product you’d like to edit in the Products tab and click on it.<img alt="Find Product You Want To Edit" classname="block dark:hidden" src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733827044/docs/Products/Edit%20a%20Multi-Variant%20Product/2.1.3.2.1_Editing_Multi-Variant_Products_-_Find_Product_You_Want_To_Edit_wkr4r7.png" />This will open the product editor for that particular product where you can edit its variants.

## Options

Scroll down to the Variants section of the product editor for an overview of all the variants associated with this product.

At the top you can see the Options that have been assigned to the product (Color and Size) and the values associated with each Option (White, Blue, S, M, etc.)

To edit these Options, click Edit next to the desired Option and an editor will open up allowing you to modify the Option Values or change the Option by selecting another one from the Option Name dropdown.

You can also add more Options by clicking “+ Add another option” at the bottom.

## Variants

Below the Option editor, you’ll find a list of each product variant as defined by the added Options. In this is example, there are 3 colors and 3 sizes which gives 9 variants total.

## Price & Quantity

There’s a good chance that you’ll have a different quantity of each variant in stock, but depending on your industry, you may also have different prices for each variant.

To edit the price and quantity of each variant, simply enter the new values into their respective fields.

## Deleting Variants

Variants are created automatically based on the Option Values you define. However, it may be the case that some of those variants are not actually products you sell.

If that’s the case, you can delete individual variants or variant groups by checking the box next to the variant and then clicking Delete.

<img alt="Deleting Product Variants" classname="block dark:hidden" src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733827045/docs/Products/Edit%20a%20Multi-Variant%20Product/2.1.3.2.7_Editing_Multi-Variant_Products_-_Deleting_Variants_kz5ozy.png" />

Doing this will clear the Price and Quantity fields and hide the Edit button for that variant. You can reverse this action by adding a Price and Quantity and clicking Update at the bottom of the page.

## Editing Variants

If the variants for a product differ greatly from one another, whether it be in size, weight, appearance, or even the intended customer, you might want to consider editing the settings of each variant to keep things more organized and to create a better user experience.

To edit a variant, simply click the Edit button on the right side and you’ll be redirected to the variant editor.

<Warning>Make sure to hit Update at the bottom of the page before clicking Edit to save any changes you’ve already made to the product, otherwise all of your changes will be lost.</Warning>

<img alt="Editing Variants" classname="block dark:hidden" src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733827046/docs/Products/Edit%20a%20Multi-Variant%20Product/2.1.3.2.8_Editing_Multi-Variants_Products_-_Editing_Variants_sbn1id.png" />

Here you can modify the following settings for this particular variant:

* SKU

* Barcode

* Tax Category

* Discontinue On date

* Width, Depth, and Height

* Weight

* Pricing and Compare At Amount

* Quantity

* Backorderability

* Media

The meaning and use of each of the above settings is covered in the support article on creating products, but Media is a bit different in the case of variants.

## Variant-Specific Media

To create a better user experience, you might consider uploading variant-specific media files that accurately reflect the characteristics of a particular variant.

For example, if you sell crew neck tshirts that come in white and blue, you could upload images of the white tshirts to the white variants, and images of the blue tshirts to the blue variants.

<img alt="Variant-Specific Media" classname="block dark:hidden" src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733827046/docs/Products/Edit%20a%20Multi-Variant%20Product/2.1.3.2.9_Editing_Multi-Variant_Products_-_Variant-Specific_Media_wzmyaa.png" />

The result is that when a user is browsing the PDP, if they click on the variant they’ll be shown the most relevant image associated with that variant.

## Don’t forget to click Update

Whether making changes in the product editor or the variant editor, always make sure to click the blue Update button at the bottom of the page, otherwise your changes will not be saved.

## Bulk Imports

If you plan on uploading hundreds or even thousands of multi-variant products, then you’ll find it much more convenient to do so in bulk using our CSV importer.

To learn more about importing products in bulk, please refer to a separate support article.
