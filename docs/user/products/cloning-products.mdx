If you plan to add many products that share similar characteristics, then you may find it more convenient to clone existing products and then edit the product information where necessary. This is especially time saving when it comes to multi-variant products.

To clone a product, first find the product you’d like to clone and click on it.

<img alt="Find The Product You Want to Clone" classname="block dark:hidden" src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733828525/docs/Products/Clone%20a%20Product/2.1.4.1_Cloning_Products_-_Find_The_Product_You_Want_to_Clone_ou9hg4.png" />

Doing so will open the product editor for this particular product.

Locate ‘More Actions’ in the top right corner and select ‘Clone’ from the dropdown.

After clicking Clone, you’ll be redirected to the product editor for the newly cloned product.

All product information will be copied from the original product, with a few exceptions:

* The ‘Name’ will change to ‘COPY OF Name’

* The slug will change from ‘/name’ to ‘/copy-of-name’

* The status will always be set to Draft

* Stock quantities will be reset to zero

You can then update the product details to match the attributes of the new product.

Once you’re happy with the changes, make sure to click Update at the bottom of the page, otherwise any changes you’ve made will not be saved.
