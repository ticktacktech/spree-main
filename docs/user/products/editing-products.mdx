There are many reasons why you may wish to edit a product:

* Change the price

* Modify or fix mistakes in the name or description

* Hide it from the storefront

* Add new images

* Change or add categories and tags

Whatever the reason, editing a product is quite straightforward in most cases.

To edit a product, first find the product you’d like to edit and click on it.

Doing so will open up the product editor for that product.

You’re free to edit any of the fields that were set when first creating the product. You can also fill in any fields that were left blank.

To learn about the [different sections of the product editor](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/user/products/creating-products), please refer to a separate support article.

Now that you’ve made all the necessary edits, simply scroll to the bottom of the page and click the blue Update button.

Once you’ve done that, a notification will pop up informing you that the product has been successfully updated.
