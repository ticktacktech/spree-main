Maintaining accurate stock levels is crucial in e-commerce for several reasons such as customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and financial management, to name a few.

There are several ways to manage stock levels in Spree:

* Update stock levels of individual products using the product editor

* Update stock levels in bulk using a CSV upload

* Update stock levels using the Stock Items tab

<Note>This support article covers the use of the Stock Items tab to update stock levels.</Note>

When a product is purchased by a customer, the quantity of the product sold is automatically deducted from the total quantity.

To get started, navigate to the Stock Items tab found under Products > Stock in the admin dashboard, where you’ll be greeted by a list of products.

This list shows the quantity of each product variant available at each of your stock locations.

You can filter the list by searching the product name, SKU (partial or full), and/or the stock location.

Once you’ve found the variant(s) for which you’d like to update the quantity, you simply need to type in the new quantity in ‘Count On Hand’ column, and click the corresponding Update button.

A green popup will appear at the top of the screen to ntofiy you that the Stock Item has been successfully updated.

You can also set whether or not to make any of your product backorderable but simply checking the box in the ‘Backorderable’ column (no need to click update - this change will automatically be saved).

<Warning>Marking products as backorderable will allow them to be sold even when out of stock, so make sure not to mark products as backorderable if you don’t intend to restock them.</Warning>
