Exporting your product catalog can be useful for several reasons. For example, you may wish to upload your products to another system or you might want to update product data in bulk.

To export your product catalog, navigate to the Products tab of the admin dashboard.

Locate the ‘Export button in the top right corner. 

Clicking on this will allow you to choose one of two options:

1. Filtered Records - Export only filtered records, matching the search criteria

2. All - Export all records (can be slow for large datasets)

If you plan to export a subset of your product catalog, make sure to apply desired filters before clicking Export.

Once you’re happy with your selection, click the blue Export button, and a link to download the file will be sent to the email address associated with your user account.

## Update Products in Bulk

If you’re planning to update product data in bulk, simply open the exported file in your preferred spreadsheet software, edit all of product fields you’d like to change, and then reupload the file to update the product data in Spree.
