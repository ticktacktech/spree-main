## Bulk Operations

When you have a fairly large product catalog, you’ll likely find it much more convenient to manage multiple products at once rather than managing each product separately. 

For that reason, there are a number of bulk operations that you can perform to make managing your product catalog less tedious and time consuming.

Bulk operations can be used to do the following: 

* Update product statuses

* Add/remove taxons

* Add/remove tags

To perform a bulk operations, navigate to the Products tab of the admin dashboard.

To bring up the bulk operations menu, simply select one or more products by checking the boxes on the lefthand side of the list.

The menu will then pop up at the bottom of the page.
