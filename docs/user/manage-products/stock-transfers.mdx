Stock transfers are crucial for multi-warehouse e-commerce businesses as it enables seamless movement of inventory between locations, ensuring optimal stock levels and reducing the risk of overstocking or stockouts. 

This improves order fulfillment efficiency, lowers shipping costs, and enhances customer satisfaction by routing products from the nearest warehouse.

### Stock Locations

By default, your store will only have one stock location, so before you can create stock transfers, you must add additional stock locations.

To do so, navigate to Locations found in Settings.

Click on the blue ‘New Stock Location’ button found in the top right corner.

You will now be able to transfer stock to your newly added warehouse.

### Creating Stock Transfers

To create a stock transfer, navigate to the Stock tab of the admin dashboard found under Products, and click on Stock Transfers above the search bar.

If you haven’t made any stock transfers before, you’ll be greeted by a blank page, with a blue ‘New Stock Transfer’ button in the top right corner of the screen.

Click on the blue ‘New Stock Transfer’ button and you’ll be redirected to another page where you can begin creating the stock transfer.

First, you must select the Origin location and the Destination location from the dropdowns.

Optionally, you can add a reference to make the transfer more easily identifiable, e.g., for auditing purposes.

Next, you should select the product variants you’d like to include in the transfers.

To do so, click on the ‘+ Add Products’ button which will open a small window where you can search for the product variants you want to add.

Start typing in the name of the product to return a list of products matching the query.

Select the variants you want to add to the transfers and click ‘Add selected variant’.

Once you’ve add all the variants that should be included in the transfer, you need only adjust the quantity of each to be transferred.

Please Note: You cannot transfer more stock than you have available at the Origin location. Doing so will result in an error message.

After adjusting the quantities, all that’s left to do is to click the blue ‘Create’ button and the transfer will be processed.

The stock levels at each warehouse will now be accurately reflected in the system, provided the physical transfer of the items has already been made.
