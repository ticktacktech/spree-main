## Searching Products

The more products you add to your store, the more challenging it becomes to manage your product catalog. 

Using search and filters can make it much more convenient to find the products you’d like to manage, as opposed to scrolling through thousands of products in the hopes of finding the one you’re looking.

To use product search and filters, navigate to the Products tab of the admin dashboard.

At the top, you’ll notice the Search bar and some filtering options. Let’s take a look at each separately.

### Search

The search bar allows you to enter a query and return a list of products that match that the query.

To remove the query, simply click the X next to the query that’s displayed below the search bar.

### Status and Stock Filter

The box that (by default) contains “Show:All products” is a dropdown that allows you to narrow product results by their status and whether or not they are in stock.

Simply click on the dropdown and select the option you’d like to filter.

You can have one filter active from each of Status and Stock at a time, and the current selection will be displayed in the box, e.g., ‘Active and In Stock’

### Filters

Filters allow you to the refine your search based on other criteria, such as taxons, vendors, and tags.
